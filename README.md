# Frink

Frink is a very simple CLI for managing Kubernetes (k8s) jobs.

The only purpose of Frink is to make it easier for researchers in the UiT Machine Learning Group
to schedule machine learning experiments as k8s jobs on our GPU cluster dubbed "Springfield".
It is not intended to be a general-purpose tool for managing k8s jobs.
